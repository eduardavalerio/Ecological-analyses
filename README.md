### Ecological-analyses-of-porifera-IC-FAPESP

I'm working with DNA barcode of marine species of Porifera using their sequences cataloged in public genetic sequence databases such as National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), 
Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD System) and SILVA ribosomal RNA database (SILVA database). Basis for research with DNA Metabarcoding as a method of monitoring biodiversity. 

In that time, I'm using codes to perform beta diversity, NMDS, ANOSIM, dendogram, genetic distance and phylogenetic tree of Porifera that I use in my research.

With these ecological analyses, it is possible to determine the distribution of porifera by location and bathymetry and comparing different composition communities through similarity indices and beta diversity. 
Furthermore, using a FASTA file containig the COI sequences of species it's possible to create a phylogenetic tree and calculate the genetic distance from these species.

Here is a LaTeX file with all my observations about the results of these analyses.
