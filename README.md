### Ecological-analyses-of-porifera-IC-FAPESP

I'm working with DNA barcode of marine species of Porifera using their sequences cataloged in public genetic sequence databases such as National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), 
Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD System) and SILVA ribosomal RNA database (SILVA database). Basis for research with DNA Metabarcoding as a method of monitoring biodiversity. 

Here have some codes to perform ANOSIM, dendogram, genetic distance and phylogenetic tree 
With these ecological analyses, it is possible to determine the distribution of porifera by location and bathymetry and comparing different communities through similarity indices. 
In addition, using a FASTA file containig the COI sequences of species it's possible to create a phylogenetic tree and calculate the genetic distance from these species.
