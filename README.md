# Beta diversity, distribution, and representativeness of sequences of marine habitat-forming species from São Paulo, Brazil 🧬🪸🏝️

I'm working with DNA barcode of marine habitat-forming species using their sequences cataloged in public genetic sequence databases, to complement the DNA Metabarcoding workflow as a method of monitoring biodiversity. 

These codes are to perform beta diversity, NMDS, ANOSIM, dendogram, genetic distance and phylogenetic tree of Porifera and Anthozoa species, based in presence/absence between sites and bathymetry data.

With these ecological analyses, it is possible to determine the distribution of these species by location and bathymetry and comparing different composition communities through similarity indices and beta diversity. Also, using FASTA file containig the sequences of species it's possible to create a phylogenetic tree and calculate the genetic distance from these species to show the efficiency of different molecular markers to distinguish species.

This repository allows to reproduce the analyses that is perfored in `R` version `4.2.3`.
